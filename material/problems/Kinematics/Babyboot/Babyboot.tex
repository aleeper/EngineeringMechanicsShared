\begin{minipage}{0.55\textwidth}
A babyboot pendulum (as shown in class) is pictured at right,
consisting of a rod \basis{A} and rectangular plate \basis{B}.
Assume the support structure is a Newtonian reference frame \basis{N}.
Sets of right-handed  orthogonal unit vectors are fixed in each frame as shown,
and angles $\theta$ and $\phi$ are indicated on the figure.
\\[0.5pc]
To clarify the figure,
$\theta$ is the angle between \uvecz{n} and \uvecz{a},
and $\phi$ is the angle between \uvecx{a} and \uvecx{b}.
%\\[0.5pc]
%Clearly \textbf{explain} why we can say $\angvel{A}{N} = + ~\thetadot~\uvecx{a}$.

%Clearly \textbf{explain} why we can say $\angvel{B}{A} = + ~\phidot~\uvecz{a}$.

%(I gave them to you so that you can do the rest of the problem, but you need to
%\textbf{convince me} that you could come up with those expressions on your own.)

\begin{itemize}
\item Form \angvel{A}{N} and \angvel{B}{A} by inspection.
\item Use the \textbf{definition} to \textbf{compute} \basis{B}'s angular acceleration in \basis{N} in terms of symbols and unit-vectors.
\end{itemize}
