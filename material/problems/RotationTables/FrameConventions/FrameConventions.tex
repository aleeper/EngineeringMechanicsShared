Creating a flight simulator requires cooperation of engineers from multiple
disciplines (graphics and aeronautics) that have different frame conventions.
Many 3D graphics applications consider the ``world" frame to be defined as
shown by vector basis \basis{C}, where the ``ground" plane is defined by
\uvecx{c} and \uvecz{c}, with \uvecy{c} pointing opposite gravity.
Meanwhile, aeronautics uses a frame convention shown by vector basis \basis{D}
, where \uvecx{d} points north, \uvecy{d} points east, and \uvecz{d} points
in the direction of gravity (this convention is often called NED, for
``north-east-down").
For clarity, in the picture below the frames \basis{C} and
\basis{D} are ``aligned'' but use a different convention. Note \uvecz{c}
is ``out" of the page and \uvecx{d} is ``in."

To properly display aeronautics simulation data (computed and expressed in
\basis{D}) in the graphics engine, the data must be re-expressed using
the basis vectors of frame \basis{C}.
Form the rotation table \dircos{c}{d} relating \uvecxyz{c} to \uvecxyz{d}.
