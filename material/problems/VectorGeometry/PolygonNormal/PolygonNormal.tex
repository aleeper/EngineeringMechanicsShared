\begin{minipage}[t]{0.68\columnwidth}
In many engineering applications (such as stress and aerodynamics computations using finite elements, as well as CAD and graphical display), objects are represented using a group of polygons. Being able to compute a ``normal'' vector perpendicular to each polygon is important for all these applications.

%For example, for drawing a polygon on screen, it is necessary to compute the illumination in a way that simulates realistic lighting. A simple model for diffuse illumination at each vertex (corner) of a polygon is defined as $I_D = I_L * \uvecWithHat{n} \cdot \uvecWithHat{L}$, where:
%\begin{itemize}
%\item $I_L$ is the (scalar) strength of the incoming light.
%\item $\uvecWithHat{L}$ is the unit vector from the vertex to the light source.
%\item $\uvecWithHat{n}$ is the ``unit-normal" for the polygon (that is, the unit vector perpendicular to the polygon).
%\end{itemize}

In the figure below, the \uvecxyz{a} ``coordinate" measures of each vertex from $A_o$ are labeled.
\\[0.0pc]
For example, $\posvec{A_o}{P_1} \equals[\;] 3~\uvecx{a} \plus[\;] 2~\uvecy{a} \plus[\;] 0~\uvecz{a}$.
\begin{enumerate}
\item \underline{Compute} a vector \bvec{n} that is perpendicular to the polygon, expressed in \uvecxyz{a}.
\item \underline{Explain} in detail how to get \uvecWithHat{n}, the unit vector in the same direction as \bvec{n}. \underline{Sketch} \uvecWithHat{n} on the figure.
\item \underline{Explain} why there are actually two possible \uvecWithHat{n} vectors for the polygon.
%\item Compute \posvec{P_0}{Q}, and hence compute the unit vector $\uvecWithHat{L}$.
%\item For a light source of strength $I_L = 0.5$, compute the diffuse illumination $I_D$.
