  The figure shows a particle $Q$, of mass $m^Q$, sliding on a semi-circular
  igloo (smooth and made of ice) of radius $R$. The igloo is fixed in a
  Newtonian reference frame $N$ and is centered at point $N_o$.
  Right-handed orthogonal unit vectors are assigned as shown.
  Assume the particle is released from rest near the top of the igloo.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Use energy methods to obtain an expression for the speed of the
    particle as a function of $\theta$.
  \item Determine the value of $\theta$ when the particle loses contact with
    the the igloo.
    \\[0.0pc]\textbf{Hint:} Do a roadmap that helps you solve for the
    relevant contact force.
  \item Now assume the igloo is made of concrete, so a solid ball $B$ with
    mass $m^B = m^Q$ rolls down the igloo. Will the ball lose contact at a
    smaller, larger, or equal value of $\theta$? Explain your reasoning.
